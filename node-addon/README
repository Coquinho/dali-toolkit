Building dali node addon for GBS

Ensure node-devel (0.12.4) rpm is install into gbs. The addon expects /usr/lib/node/node.h to exists
in the gbs environment

sudo gbs  build -A armv7l --include-all --ccache --keep-packs --spec dali-addon.spec

Building for Ubuntu desktop:

2 options:

option 1 (easy):  in node-addon folder type

$ node-gyp build

option 2 (harder)
Ensure node-js source has been downloaded and built from source.
It doesn't have to be installed anywhere (make sure node executable is in your PATH).

In node-addon/build/tizen direction, run cmake, with the source directory of node

cmake -DDesktopNodePath:String=/home/my-user/Downloads/node-v0.12.4 .
make
